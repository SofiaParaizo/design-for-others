## About the Project
This project is designed to create a comprehensive streaming hub platform tailored for SODA (School of Digital Arts) students at Manchester Metropolitan University. The platform serves as a centralised space where students can access various exclusive content, including educational videos, tutorials, and community-driven resources.

The goal is to provide a user-friendly, accessible, and visually engaging experience that fosters learning, creativity, and collaboration within the SODA community. Through this platform, students can easily discover content that aligns with their interests and academic pursuits. The website allows students to access content across multiple devices, ensuring seamless usability whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile.
