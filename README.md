# üë©‚Äçüíª SODA+  |  Design for Others

## About the Project
This project is designed to create a comprehensive streaming hub platform tailored for SODA (School of Digital Arts) students at Manchester Metropolitan University. It is a centralised space where students can access exclusive content, including educational videos, tutorials, and community-driven resources.

The goal is to provide a user-friendly, accessible, and visually engaging experience that fosters learning, creativity, and collaboration within the SODA community. Through this platform, students can easily discover content that aligns with their interests and academic pursuits. The website allows students to access content across multiple devices, ensuring seamless usability whether on desktop, tablet, or mobile. 

## Performance Insights
Using tools like [WhoCanUse](https://www.whocanuse.com/?bg=ffffff&fg=0c6dfd&fs=16&fw=), PageSpeed Insights, and WAVE Evaluation, I conducted a thorough review of my design and content to ensure it aligns with WCAG standards for accessibility and performance. These tools helped me identify areas where improvements were needed, such as colour contrast, navigation structure, and responsive design. By addressing these issues, I aimed to create a user-friendly experience that is inclusive for all users, including those with disabilities. This process also allowed me to validate my choices and demonstrate a commitment to accessibility and usability throughout the project.
- [**WhoCanUse:**](https://www.whocanuse.com/?bg=ffffff&fg=0c6dfd&fs=16&fw=) The chosen colour scheme (white background and blue accent) passed 10 of 14 accessibility tests, ensuring sufficient contrast for most users, including those with visual impairments. However, it flagged some issues for specific disabilities, such as those suffering from cataracts, low vision, direct sunlight, and night shift mode.
